Current Status:

Completed:

PatientsController with full CRUD operations, including duplicate email handling and HIPAA-compliant audit logging.

PatientService integrated with _fhirService for FHIR synchronization and _context for local database operations.

JWT authentication and encryption for Protected Health Information (PHI).

Successful testing of patient creation, retrieval, update, and deletion with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 201 Created, 409 Conflict for duplicates).

Partially Implemented:
AppointmentModel.cs, IAppointmentService.cs, and AppointmentService.cs might exist in the project structure but require full implementation.
Key Files:
TelehealthApi.Api/Controllers/PatientsController.cs: Handles API requests for patient management.
TelehealthApi.Core/Services/PatientService.cs: Implements business logic for patient operations, including FHIR integration.
TelehealthApi.Core/Models/PatientModel.cs: Defines the patient data model.
TelehealthApi.Core/Interfaces/IAuditLogService.cs and TelehealthApi.Core/Services/AuditLogService.cs: Manage audit logging.
TelehealthApi.Api/Program.cs: Configures services and middleware.
TelehealthApi.Core/TelehealthDbContext.cs: Entity Framework Core context for database operations.
TelehealthApi.Core/Models/AppointmentModel.cs: Placeholder for the appointment data model.
TelehealthApi.Core/Interfaces/IAppointmentService.cs: Interface for appointment operations.
TelehealthApi.Core/Services/AppointmentService.cs: Partial implementation for appointment logic.

Next Steps
To complete the core features of the MVP, we need to fully implement the Appointment resource, essential for telehealth scheduling. The plan is to:
Define AppointmentModel.cs: Finalize the appointment data structure based on FHIR R4 standards (e.g., include fields like PatientId, StartTime, EndTime, Status).
Define IAppointmentService.cs: Specify CRUD method signatures for appointments, ensuring consistency with IPatientService.
Implement AppointmentService.cs: Add business logic for appointment operations, integrating with _fhirService for FHIR synchronization and _auditLogService for logging.
Develop AppointmentsController.cs: Create JWT-authenticated endpoints for appointment management (e.g., POST /api/appointments, GET /api/appointments/{id}).
